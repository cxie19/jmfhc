Description: We propose a joint model with a flexible-hazards cure submodel (JMFHC).
    This new cure model accounting for longitudinal data and flexible 
    patterns of hazard functions simultaneously handles some baseline covariates 
    with PH structure and others with non-PH structure in the longitudinal 
    and cure-survival data.
    It is a joint model with individual random effects shared between 
    cure-survival and longitudinal submodels.
    When the PH assumption is violated, JMFHC easily accommodates crossing 
    or non-crossing survival functions by allowing different relative hazard 
    rates in both the short and long terms and obtains accurate estimated cure 
    rates for subgroups.
    This package can fit a JMFHC with point estimation and standard error estimation.
    Estimated cure rates and survival functions can aslo be obtained.
